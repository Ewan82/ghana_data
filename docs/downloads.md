# Downloading data

## Pre-requisites

Some of the services that we'll leech the data from require annoying accounts. These have to be set-up first and are assumed to be working.

### Copernicus Data Service API

Basically, you just need [to follow the instructions](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to). You sign-up to the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/), create an account, and then just follow the instructions.

### MODIS Downloading

For this, you need to create an [EarthData Login account](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new). Once you have this, you probably want to try to download a product with that account to activate it. You can do this by just clicking on this **link** and downloading it.

## Downloading the data itself

Once you have set-up the accounts above, you can easily download the data using command line tools, or developing your own codes
