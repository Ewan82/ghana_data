# Introduction

The aim of these notes is to introduce two things:

1. The ability to download and process data over Ghana from a range of sources, and
2. To demonstrate how you can access the data and do some hopefully funky plots.

The first part has been implemented in the JASMIN faiclity, but can be easily transposed to other HPC setups (or any computer with a large disk). The second part can be used anywhere via Python notebooks, under the assumption that the downloaded data is available via HTTP. However, a more optimal approach might be to run these locally to avoid delays due to latency and bandwith limitations over HTTP.
